## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Ivan Efimov** ðŸ™‹

Results-oriented data analyst with 2 years of experience. I also have 5 years of experience as a project manager. I do analytics because it gives me confidence in the correctness and validity of decisions. In work and life, I like to compare different options to find the most optimal and profitable one.

**Primary skills:**
- SQL, Python (pandas, numpy, math, matplotlib, scipy, seaborn, folium, plotly), Google Sheets, Excel
- Tableau, Lookerstudio, Yandex.Metrika
- Jira, Confluence, Trello
- Market analysis, financial modeling 

âš¡ Fun fact: As a pet project, I created a table to evaluate stocks and find undervalued assets. I played in a community theater on the stage of the Novosibirsk House of Actors.
